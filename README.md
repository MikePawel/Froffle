## Description

We have developed an advanced online reputation platform designed to evaluate various wallet addresses, allowing companies to establish specific eligibility criteria for airdrops. In the current landscape, airdrops occur frequently, almost monthly. However, we observed that a significant portion of these airdrops end up with individuals driven solely by financial incentives, leading them to cash out immediately and potentially harm the project.

To address this issue, we created a smart tool that assesses each wallet address and assigns a score based on comprehensive data mining techniques. This approach ensures that airdrops are distributed to participants who are genuinely interested in contributing to the project's success, fostering a healthier and more engaged community.


## How its made

This web application is developed using React, Node.js, and smart contracts, ensuring a robust and efficient platform. The smart contracts are deployed on Ethereum Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia using Blockscout for seamless integration.

To verify that our users are humans, we utilize WorldID, providing an added layer of security and trust. For user connectivity to the dApp, we employ WalletConnect, ensuring a smooth and secure connection experience.

Additionally, we leverage Chainlink CCIP to facilitate cross-chain airdrop transfers, enhancing the functionality and reach of our platform. The video can be found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOCbMuParTU
